# Just-Do-It
# Oklahoma Crime Data Analysis Project Report

## Introduction

The Oklahoma Crime Data Analysis Project investigates crime trends across Oklahoma cities from 2014 to 2023. The project integrates crime statistics, geographic coordinates, and labor data to standardize inconsistent datasets, establish a robust MySQL database, impute missing values, and derive actionable insights through correlation analysis, predictive modeling, and interactive visualizations in Power BI. The tools utilized include VBA, Python, SQL, and Power BI, enabling comprehensive data cleaning, organization, analysis, and presentation.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Sources

The crime data was sourced from the FBI Crime Data Explorer, specifically the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) Tables, which provide incident-based crime data for Oklahoma. The dataset was initially downloaded as a PDF from [https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#) and subsequently converted into Excel format for processing.

### Initial Data Cleaning

Upon conversion to Excel, the dataset exhibited several issues:

- **Merged Columns**: The Excel sheet contained merged columns, which were manually corrected to ensure proper data structure.
- **Missing Data for Universities**: Data for universities (Carl Albert State College, Oklahoma State University, University of Oklahoma, and Sallisaw) was missing. These rows were removed from the dataset, as they lacked sufficient information for analysis.

### Challenges

Further examination revealed inconsistencies across the annual datasets (2014â€“2023):

- **Missing Columns**:
  - `animal_cruelty`, `identity_theft`, and `hacking_computer_invasion` were absent in 2014 and 2015.
  - `sex_offenses_non_forcible` was missing in 2018, 2019, and from 2020 to 2023.
- **Renamed Columns**:
  - In 2023, the `fondling` offense was renamed to `criminal_sexual_contact`. To maintain consistency across years, it was reverted to `fondling`, despite slight definitional differences: `fondling` refers to intentional, non-consensual touching of intimate areas for sexual gratification, often categorized as a forcible sex offense, whereas `criminal_sexual_contact` is a broader legal term that may include `fondling` but also other forms of non-consensual sexual touching without penetration.

### Standardization Process

To address these discrepancies, a VBA script was developed in Microsoft Excel to compare column names and their order across workbooks, using the 2014 dataset as the reference.

##### Data Loading
Data was imported into the database using LOAD DATA INFILE commands, ensuring proper formatting:

LOAD DATA INFILE 'C:/ProgramData/MySQL/MySQL Server 8.0/Uploads/oklahoma_cities.csv'
INTO TABLE cities
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
ENCLOSED BY '"'
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
IGNORE 1 LINES
(city_name, latitude, longitude);



#### Remote Access
The database was connected to Google Colab using ngrok for remote access and analysis:

import pymysql

connection = pymysql.connect(
    host="4.tcp.ngrok.io",
    port=16944,
    user="proot",
    password="I*********5",
    database="oklahoma_crime_data"
)
print("Connection successful!")



###### Data Imputation
To address missing data, a new table, crimedata_imputed, was created by imputing values for cities with at least seven years of data.

Methodology
Filtering: Identified cities with seven or more years of data.
Imputation Process:
Replaced zeros with NaN in crime-related columns (excluding population).
Applied linear interpolation across years for each numeric column.
Filled remaining gaps with the city-specific mean for each column, defaulting to 0 if the mean was unavailable.
Python Script for Imputation

import numpy as np

connection = pymysql.connect(host="4.tcp.ngrok.io", port=16944, user="proot", password="I**********5", database="oklahoma_crime_data")

cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE crimedata_imputed LIKE crimedata;")

df = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM crimedata", connection)
all_years = pd.read_sql("SELECT year FROM years", connection)["year"].tolist()

years_per_city = df.groupby("city_id")["year"].nunique()
cities_with_7_plus_years = years_per_city[years_per_city >= 7].index.tolist()

            city_mean = merged_data[col].mean()
            merged_data[col] = merged_data[col].fillna(city_mean if not np.isnan(city_mean) else 0)
        merged_data[col] = merged_data[col].fillna(0)
    df_imputed_full = pd.concat([df_imputed_full, merged_data], ignore_index=True)

df_imputed_full = df_imputed_full.drop(columns=["crime_id"])
columns = df_imputed_full.columns.tolist()
insert_query = f"INSERT INTO crimedata_imputed ({', '.join(columns)}) VALUES ({', '.join(['%s'] * len(columns))})"
cursor.executemany(insert_query, df_imputed_full.values.tolist())
connection.commit()
connection.close()


### Data Analysis
Correlation Analysis
Using the crimedata_imputed table, correlations between population and crime variables were calculated:

Strong Correlations:
crimes_against_property: 0.966
larceny_theft_offenses: 0.961
fraud_offenses: 0.950
Weak Correlations:
purchasing_prostitution: 0.040
involuntary_servitude: -0.019
betting_wagering: -0.018
NaN Values: sports_tampering resulted in NaN due to zero variance (all values likely 0), triggering a NumPy warning (RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in divide).

### Predictive Modeling
Predictive models were trained to forecast population using crime variety variables, excluding total_offenses, crime_rate, year, latitude, and longitude.
